June 2016 Release 4.0

A prerelease of Gridded Population of the World Version 4 (GPWv4) was made available in the 4th quarter of 2015 in a "Beta" web environment. There have been a number of changes to the GPWv4 collection between the Beta release and version 4.0


This file contains a description of those changes and information on how to obtain the Beta version of GPWv4.

Change log:

New datasets:
	National Identifier Grid
		<To provide a raster representation of nation-states in GPWv4 for use in aggregating population data.>

	Data Quality Indicators Mean Administrative Unit Area
		<provides a quantitative surface that indicates the size of the input unit(s) from which population count and density grids are derived.>


Country level changes:
	Egypt (EGY): The Beta version of Egypt's administrative boundaries and population estimates were found to be inaccurate. As a result a new source was acquired and incorporated into version 4.0

	Panama (PAN): corrected data integration errors

	Poland (POL): corrected data integration errors
